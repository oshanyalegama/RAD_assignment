# YOLOv5s with Aspect Ratio and Center Alignment Loss

This project modifies the YOLOv5s loss function by adding two additional terms: **Aspect Ratio Loss** and **Center Alignment Loss**. These modifications are integrated into the existing loss function to improve the bounding box predictions for a custom dataset consisting of **cats and dogs**.

## New Loss Function

The new loss function combines the original YOLOv5s loss with the added aspect ratio and center alignment loss terms. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the original and modified loss functions:

### Original YOLOv5s Loss Function

The original YOLOv5s loss function includes the following components:
1. **IoU Loss**: Measures the intersection over union of predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
2. **Objectness Loss**: Binary cross-entropy loss to predict the presence of an object.
3. **Classification Loss**: Binary cross-entropy loss for classifying objects.

### Modified Loss Function

The modified loss function includes the same components as the original loss function, with the addition of:
1. **Aspect Ratio Loss**: Measures the difference in aspect ratio between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes to encourage more accurate box dimensions.
   
   \[
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{aspect}} = \left| \frac{w_{\text{pred}}}{h_{\text{pred}}} - \frac{w_{\text{gt}}}{h_{\text{gt}}} \right|
   \]
   
2. **Center Alignment Loss**: Calculates the L2 distance between the predicted and ground truth bounding box centers to improve the precision of the object localization.
   
   \[
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{center}} = \| \mathbf{c}_{\text{pred}} - \mathbf{c}_{\text{gt}} \|_2^2
   \]

The final loss function is a weighted sum of the original YOLOv5s loss terms and the added aspect ratio and center alignment loss terms:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \lambda_{\text{IoU}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{IoU}} + \lambda_{\text{center}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{center}} + \lambda_{\text{aspect}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{aspect}} + \lambda_{\text{obj}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{obj}} + \lambda_{\text{BCE}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{BCE}}
\]

Where \(\lambda_{\text{IoU}}, \lambda_{\text{center}}, \lambda_{\text{aspect}}, \lambda_{\text{obj}}, \lambda_{\text{BCE}}\) are the weights for each component of the loss function.

## Custom Dataset

This project was trained on a custom dataset consisting of **cats** and **dogs** images. The dataset is used to detect and classify these two object types, and the new loss function was designed to improve the precision of the bounding box predictions.
